    "In this series of exercises, we delve into the fascinating realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using two classic literary works: \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll and \"Frankenstein\" by Mary Shelley. These exercises focus on various NLP tasks, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), text classification, and feature importance analysis using machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "We start by preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features, and labeling entities such as names of characters, locations, and organizations in the first chapters of both books. Next, we explore different machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees (DTs), and Random Forests (RFs), to perform text classification tasks."
