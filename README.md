# NCCR_MWQTA_2024
Methods Workshop in Quantitative Text Analysis 2024

3-7 June 2024
University of Neuch√¢tel


The workshop aims to bring together NCCR PhD students, fellows and project leaders 
that use, or aim to use, quantitative text analysis in their projects. The workshop will be 
segmented with different topics on different days, this way participants can participate on 
the specific day(s) where the program best overlaps with their research interests and com-
petence. The first two days are optional introductions to the programming languages used 
in the workshop and to text pre-processing, to make sure we have a baseline level for all 
participants. The two introduction days (3-4 June) will be open to doctoral students enrolled 
in a CUSO program.
