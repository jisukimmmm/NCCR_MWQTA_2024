    "\n",
    "Here, we'll be diving into various text processing techniques, using the beloved classic \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll as our playground.This exercise set will guide you through a series of hands-on tasks aimed at developing your skills in string manipulation, text normalization, tokenization, and more advanced topics like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Word Embeddings. Each exercise is crafted to help you understand the underlying principles of text analysis while engaging with the whimsical and imaginative text of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\n",

      "\n",
      "  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\n",
      "solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\n",

      "doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\n",

      "them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\n",
      "curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\n",
      "door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\n",
      "in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\n",
      "passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\n",
      "looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\n",
      "How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\n",
      "among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\n",
      "she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\n",
      "my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\n",
      "very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\n",
      "I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\n",
      "know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\n",

      "telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\n",
      "certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\n",
      "of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\n",
      "beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\n",

      "first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\n",
      "for she had read several nice little histories about children who\n",
      "had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\n",
      "things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\n",
      "their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\n",
      "will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\n",
      "never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n",
      "`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\n",
      "later.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\n",
      "to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\n",
      "of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\n",
      "turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\n",

      "ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\n",
      "on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!\n",

      "little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\n",

      "quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb\n",
      "up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying,\n",
      "the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\n",
      "herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\n",
      "She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\n",
      "seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\n",
      "severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\n",
      "trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\n",
      "of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\n",
      "child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\n",

      "there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\n",
      "person!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\n",
      "the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\n",
      "which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\n",
      "`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\n",
      "I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\n",
      "under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\n",

      "  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\n",

      "feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\n",

      "very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\n",
      "I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\n",
      "know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\n",

      "\n",
      "  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\n",
      "went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\n",
      "it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\n",
      "telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\n",
      "certainly was not here before,' said Jisu,) and round the neck\n",
      "of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\n",
      "beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\n",
      "Jisu was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\n",
      "first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\n",
      "for she had read several nice little histories about children who\n",
      "had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\n",
      "things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\n",
      "their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\n",
      "will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\n",
      "never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n",
      "`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\n",
      "later.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Jisu ventured\n",
      "to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\n",
      "of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\n",
      "turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\n",

      "\n",
      "  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\n",
      "her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\n",
      "size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\n",
      "First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\n",

      "ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\n",
      "on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Jisu!\n",
      "when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the\n",
      "little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\n",
      "she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\n",
      "quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb\n",
      "up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying,\n",
      "the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Jisu to\n",
      "herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\n",
      "She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\n",
      "seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\n",
      "severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\n",
      "trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\n",
      "of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\n",
      "child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\n",

      "there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\n",
      "person!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\n",

      "which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\n",
      "`Well, I'll eat it,' said Jisu, `and if it makes me grow larger,\n",
      "I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\n",
      "under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\n",
      "don't care which happens!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\n",
